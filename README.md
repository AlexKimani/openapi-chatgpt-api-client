# OpenAI ChatGPT REST Client
This is a simple Spring Reactive Webflux client to interface with [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) to POST questions 
to the service and receive responses.
Some OpenAPI attributes appended to the request are:

**Model**
The model is a machine learning model. In this example, I am using the popular model called `text-davinci-002`. This model is used to predict data.

**Max token**
This is used to specify the max number of tokens generated by the model.

**Temperature**
The temperature parameter in GPT-3 is a hyper-parameter that controls the randomness or creativity of the modelâ€™s outputs.
Lower temperatures give more conservative and predictable output, while higher temperatures give more creative and varied output.

**Top P**
The top p parameter specifies a sampling threshold during inference time. It is actually another way to control the randomness and creativity of the text.

### Build
